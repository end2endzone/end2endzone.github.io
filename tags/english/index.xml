&lt;h1 id="required-hardware">Required Hardware&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>This project requires the following hardware:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi 4 (with the required parts)
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>4GB of ram&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 16GB SD card&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A micro HDMI cable&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Monitor with HDMI input&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A 15.3W USB-C Power Supply (3A @ 5v power supply)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Raspberry Pi 4 case. Preferably a passive cooling case for noise consideration.&lt;br>
I used the &lt;a href="https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-raspberry-pi-4-case.html">Argon One&lt;/a> case.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An HDHomeRun Dual tuner from &lt;a href="https://www.silicondust.com/">Silicondust&lt;/a>. The oldest model will do. For this build, I used the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=HDHR3-US&amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;tbm=isch&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwjquKyuvsbuAhWkrFkKHXbmCLMQ_AUoA3oECAEQBQ&amp;amp;biw=1920&amp;amp;bih=927">&lt;em>HDHR3-US&lt;/em>&lt;/a> which dates back to 2012-2013.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>An over-the-air tv antenna for ATSC signals. For this build I use the &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=Antennas&amp;#43;Direct&amp;#43;Clearstream&amp;#43;4&amp;#43;antenna">Clearstream 4&lt;/a> antenna by Antennas Direct.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>This post is a follow up on command line arguments. I recently published a C++ library (&lt;a href="https://end2endzone.github.io/libargvcodec-a-c-library-which-properly-encode-and-decode-command-line-arguments/">libArgvCodec&lt;/a>) which properly handles all encoding and decoding of command line arguments. It is much safer to use the library than simply wrap each argument with double quotes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is about the list of rules that the library implements for encoding and decoding of arguments.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://end2endzone.github.io/libargvcodec-a-c-library-which-properly-encode-and-decode-command-line-arguments/">libArgvCodec&lt;/a> library can be used for free and is released as Open Source. The code is available &lt;a href="https://github.com/end2endzone/libArgvCodec/archive/refs/tags/1.1.0.zip">here&lt;/a>.

&lt;p>This post is about a decade old problem: how to properly encode command line arguments. Properly encoding string arguments into a long command line should not be a complicated issue. However, I have seen multiple situations where people wrongfully assume that wrapping each argument with double quotes is &amp;lsquo;safe enough&amp;rsquo; for most situations. That is simply not true.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This article is about the C++ library libArgvCodec which properly encodes and decodes command line parameters.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>libVariant – A c++ library which encapsulate any value of variant types</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/libvariant-a-c-library-which-encapsulate-any-value-of-variant-types/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 May 2017 21:06:45 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/libvariant-a-c-library-which-encapsulate-any-value-of-variant-types/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The following article is about my new c++ library: libVariant. The library allows one to easily store/encapsulate a value of any c++ type into an instance of type Variant. The library is useful for declaring objects, interfaces, APIs or plugins to be type-independent.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="purpose">Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The libVariant library allows one to create an instance of Variant class. The class is a type safe and value safe union between all known basic c++ types. An instance of a Variant class encapsulates a single value of any c++ type: signed and unsigned integers, floating points &amp;amp; strings.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to convert arduino code to actual RTTTL melodies using libRtttl and AnyRtttl</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/how-to-convert-arduino-code-to-actual-rtttl-melodies-using-librtttl-and-anyrtttl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Dec 2016 18:03:50 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/how-to-convert-arduino-code-to-actual-rtttl-melodies-using-librtttl-and-anyrtttl/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The following article is written in order to demonstrate how my arduino libraries &lt;a href="https://end2endzone.github.io/librtttl-a-c-library-with-ui-for-compressingoptimizing-the-rtttl-audio-format/">libRtttl&lt;/a> &amp;amp; &lt;a href="https://end2endzone.github.io/anyrtttl-a-feature-rich-arduino-library-for-playing-rtttl-melodies/">AnyRtttl&lt;/a> can be used to convert arduino code (&lt;code>tone()&lt;/code> and &lt;code>delay()&lt;/code> functions calls) into actual RTTTL melodies.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The reason I started this project is because I recently had a bad experience flying a quadcopter too far from me until I was not able to distinguish if the quad was facing me or not. It does not require much distance before a quadcopter looks like a tiny black dot in the sky. Basically, I lost orientation of the quad and I had to land way too far from my takeoff location.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>csvplot – A command line script which uses Microsoft Excel to plot a graph from a Comma-separated values (CSV) file</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/csvplot-a-command-line-script-which-uses-microsoft-excel-to-plot-a-graph-from-a-comma-separated-values-csv-file/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Aug 2016 17:30:03 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/csvplot-a-command-line-script-which-uses-microsoft-excel-to-plot-a-graph-from-a-comma-separated-values-csv-file/</guid><description>&lt;p class="postedit">

&lt;p>RTTTL songs available on the internet are not optimized for the smallest size. Still they are readable by a human but they are far from optimized for the arduino embedded device.

&lt;p>As most arduino developers have faced, the amount of memory available on embedded devices is pretty limited. Having a way to save bits or our precious memory is interesting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>NonBlockingRTTTL – A non-blocking arduino library for playing RTTTL melodies</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/nonblockingrtttl-a-non-blocking-arduino-library-for-playing-rtttl-melodies/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Mar 2016 15:16:54 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/nonblockingrtttl-a-non-blocking-arduino-library-for-playing-rtttl-melodies/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>

&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time-lapse_photography">Time-lapse photography&lt;/a> is a wonderful effect to make your images alive instead of static because you can make a plain (or almost boring) event and make it so much more dramatic. However, it is something that usually needs a lot of time investment to get something acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering my family was planning to decorate the Christmas tree during the weekend, I decided to take my camera and capture the whole event in a time-lapse video.

&lt;p>Shooting a waterfall with a DSLR camera is not that hard. As usual in photography, you need a lot a patience. The perfect picture is all about managing a long exposure of the waterfall. This will get you a nice look as if the waterfall would be a silk river. In this guide, I will explain how I managed to get this picture of the &amp;ldquo;Chute du Diable&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="context">Context&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>During summer 2014, I went camping with my family to Mont-Tremblant and as always, I have brought my camera with me. I was lucky enough to bring all my camera gears since I was not expecting that I would have to use almost all of them to get a nice picture of a waterfall.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIY Kitchen under cabinet led lighting</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/diy-kitchen-under-cabinet-led-lighting/</link><pubDate>Thu, 14 Aug 2014 17:30:40 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/diy-kitchen-under-cabinet-led-lighting/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>There is something missing in most kitchens I have seen in my life and it is not a huge free space or a smart refrigerator. It is much simpler than that. I am talking about good lighting. All kitchen that I have used had decent lighting when used during a bright shiny day but was lacking appropriate lighting during a rainy days or nights. Most of then were also missing under cabinet lighting.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My expectations and things I would like to shoot</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/my-expectations-and-things-i-would-like-to-shoot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2014 10:20:35 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/my-expectations-and-things-i-would-like-to-shoot/</guid><description>&lt;p>What I expect from photography? I don&amp;rsquo;t really know. It&amp;rsquo;s a hobby after all but over time I managed to think about cool things I would like to shoot. Most of them are technical challenges but some of them have a geographical difficulty level. Others are only possible during a specific period of the year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is my list of what I would hunt for a good shoot:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Note: I will try to update this post as I managed to find the opportunity to shoot one of those. Come back later to see what new ideas I added or what I&amp;rsquo;ve done (strike trough).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How photography all started</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/how-photography-all-started/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Aug 2014 01:34:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/how-photography-all-started/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone. This is my first post regarding photography. I recently started this hobby but I had an interest in photography since a long time but never pursued this hobby because I always tough that good photography skills were not achievable or simply because you need a lot of gears that are expensive. Unfortunately, I changed my mind and rediscovered photography.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="misconceptions">Misconceptions&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>I always had high expectations about what a good camera should do and one of them was quick shooting in continuous mode (read 10-15fps). That feature was handy when you shoot moving objects or when you go to a water park because it allows you to freeze the action. (I tough high fps in continuous mode means a higher shutter speed)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>DIY Custom baby gate</title><link>https://end2endzone.github.io/diy-custom-baby-gate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 20:40:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://end2endzone.github.io/diy-custom-baby-gate/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Following the birth of a child and after the celebration is all the stuff you have to buy to protect the house of &amp;ldquo;potential dangers&amp;rdquo;. Quickly, you realize that you need to buy a baby gate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I looked at several models and I have not found a model that can suit my needs and my situation. I needed a baby gate that can:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Cover a length of at least 52 inches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Operate at an angle of 41.9 degrees.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Attachable to a wall and a stair railing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Non-intrusive (it should not leave any mark on the ramp once removed).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Strong enough to withstand a child jumping on it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Unfortunately, the area to be protected is very large and I have not managed to find a gate that is long enough and solid to block the access to the stairs. This is how I started this project: ​​build my own baby gate.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
