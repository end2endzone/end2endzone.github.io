&lt;p&gt;After 1½ month of flying the plane, I was feeling a little more confident and I trusted enough myself for doing loops.  So at the end of the 2013 season, I went flying with a friend with my Super Cub LP. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting any disaster&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During summer 2013, I have found myself with a high interest in flying an RC plane. I didn’t know what to expect from this but I wanted to get a new toy to play with. Like everyone, I thought that flying a plane was not that hard and that I could easily manage to fly any kind of plane. I was wrong. During my search for the best plane, I learned about the &lt;a href=&#34;http://secure.hobbyzone.com/catalog/hz/HBZ7300.html&#34;&gt;Hobby Zone Super Cub LP RTF&lt;/a&gt; which I think is a really good plane for a beginner.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
