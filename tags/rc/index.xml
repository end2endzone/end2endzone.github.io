&lt;p>The reason I started this project is because I recently had a bad experience flying a quadcopter too far from me until I was not able to distinguish if the quad was facing me or not. It does not require much distance before a quadcopter looks like a tiny black dot in the sky. Basically, I lost orientation of the quad and I had to land way too far from my takeoff location.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to multiplex RC Transmitter switches into a single channel</title><link>http://localhost:1313/how-to-multiplex-rc-transmitter-switches-into-a-single-channel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Mar 2016 17:15:24 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/how-to-multiplex-rc-transmitter-switches-into-a-single-channel/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>In a personal project, I wanted to add 2 new devices to an existing quadcopter. The quadcopter was equipped with a 6-channel receiver meaning I only had 1 spare channel to control the 2 devices:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="rc-channels">
 &lt;table>
 &lt;thead>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;th>&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>&lt;/th>
 &lt;th>&lt;/th>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;/thead>
 &lt;tbody>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 1&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Throttle&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 2&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Rudder&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 3&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Ailerons&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 4&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Elevator&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 5&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>Flight mode&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;tr>
 &lt;td>CH 6&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>:&lt;/td>
 &lt;td>???&lt;/td>
 &lt;/tr>
 &lt;/tbody>
&lt;/table>

&lt;/div>

&lt;p>The following arduino library was written to use the findings found during the &lt;em>&lt;strong>&lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/mapping-rc-transmitter-pwm-signal-to-actual-transmitter-values/">Mapping RC Transmitter PWM signal to actual transmitter values&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>&lt;/em> article. All results were wrapped into a library for ease of use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RcReceiverSignal is an arduino library that allows one to read a signal sent from a Remote Controlled (RC) receiver.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Skip to the &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/rcreceiversignal-an-arduino-library-for-retreiving-the-rc-transmitter-value-from-an-rc-receiver-pulse/#Download">download section&lt;/a> for quick download.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="purpose">Purpose&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>The RcReceiverSignal library allows one to easily configure an input pin to read a PWM signal sent from a RC receiver by attaching a RcReceiverSignal instance to a pin connected the receiver and automatically monitor each pulse sent by the receiver.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mapping RC Transmitter PWM signal to actual transmitter values</title><link>http://localhost:1313/mapping-rc-transmitter-pwm-signal-to-actual-transmitter-values/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Mar 2016 20:47:29 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/mapping-rc-transmitter-pwm-signal-to-actual-transmitter-values/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you ever need to use an RC Transmitter &amp;amp; receiver for a personal project, an easy way to retrieve the signal is to connect the receiver to a micro-controller.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, decoding the signal to get actual transmitter values is not as easy as it sounds. You need to know the correct encoding and searching on the internet about the subject gives erratic results.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here is the full article that explains how to correctly map an RC Transmitter PWM signal to actual transmitter values.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Demystifying RC Transmitter Mixing</title><link>http://localhost:1313/demystifying-rc-transmitter-mixing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 17:44:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/demystifying-rc-transmitter-mixing/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="introduction">Introduction&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>If you look on the internet for &amp;ldquo;mixing&amp;rdquo;, you will usually find posts and articles of people asking for things like &amp;ldquo;what is the best mix I should use for this or that&amp;rdquo; which I think is not helpful. I think it is far more helpful to actually understand what mixing is and how it can help you improve your skills as a pilot. Lately I wanted to understand how mixing could help me in a personal project. I took this opportunity to learn something new and try to demystifying RC Transmitter Mixing.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>RC Transmitter Mix Calculator</title><link>http://localhost:1313/rc-transmitter-mix-calculator/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2016 17:43:43 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/rc-transmitter-mix-calculator/</guid><description>&lt;p>This is an Excel worksheet I created based on the calculations I found for calculating most R/C Transmitter mixes. It is designed to help you identify the effective range of a mix (finding the low, medium and high values).&lt;/p>

I wanted to change the rubber nose to get a better grip on my &lt;a href="http://localhost:1313/tag/avistar-elite/">Avistar Elite&lt;/a> spinner. I ended up disassembling the whole unit before understanding what I should have done.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This guide documents the steps and tricks I used to reassemble the unit. I hope it may help someone that have the same issue. If not, then I shall use this article as a way for me to remember how I did the maintenance on the starter and which tool I used&amp;hellip;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Final flight of a Super Cub LP</title><link>http://localhost:1313/final-flight-of-a-super-cub-lp/</link><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2014 00:27:05 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://localhost:1313/final-flight-of-a-super-cub-lp/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="the-good">The Good&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>After 1Â½ month of flying the plane, I was feeling a little more confident and I trusted enough myself for doing loops. So at the end of the 2013 season, I went flying with a friend with my Super Cub LP. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting any disaster&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It was a little cloudy &amp;amp; windy but I went flying anyway because I was too much confident that nothing could happen since I had 6-7 flights of experience!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
