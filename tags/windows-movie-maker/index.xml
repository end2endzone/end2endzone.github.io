&lt;p>&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/time-lapse_photography">Time-lapse photography&lt;/a> is a wonderful effect to make your images alive instead of static because you can make a plain (or almost boring) event and make it so much more dramatic. However, it is something that usually needs a lot of time investment to get something acceptable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Considering my family was planning to decorate the Christmas tree during the weekend, I decided to take my camera and capture the whole event in a time-lapse video.
To get a nice video, you need to prepare yourself before taking the shots because if you don&amp;rsquo;t, you can end up with a bad picture set and have a hard time merging all pictures together.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
